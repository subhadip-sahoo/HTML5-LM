                            <p>Bispectral Index™ (BIS™) monitoring systems enable anesthesia professionals to access processed EEG information as a measure of the effect of certain anesthetics during the care of
                            patients they select to monitor. The clinical impact of BIS™
                            monitoring has been demonstrated in a variety of randomized
                            controlled trials that reveal the potential for BIS monitoring
                            to facilitate improvements—including patient safety—in
                            anesthesia care.</p>
                            <p>Because BIS monitoring may be new to some anesthesia
                            professionals, it is important to recognize the fundamental
                            elements of BIS™ technology and appreciate the linkages
                            between the BIS monitoring information and the clinical status
                            of the patient. Prior to using BIS monitoring information as an
                            adjunct to guide anesthesia care, it is also important to review
                            important situations and limitations that can influence the BIS
                            monitoring number.</p>
                            <p>A more in-depth discussion of the following key points can be found in this guide:</p>
                            <ul class="dash-ul">
                                <li>
                                    <h4>BIS™ Index: A Processed EEG Parameter with Clinical Validation (See Page 5)</h4>
                                    <p> – The BIS Index is the output from advanced EEG signal
                                analysis offered by Covidien. During signal analysis,
                                multiple characteristics of the EEG are determined. The
                                BIS™ algorithm was developed to quantify the changes in
                                these EEG features that best correlate with drug-induced
                                changes in clinical state.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                   <h4>BIS™ Monitoring Clinical Range: A Continuum Concept (See Page 7)</h4>
                                <p> – The BIS Index is a dimensionless number scaled to
                                clinical end points as well as specific EEG features. Awake,
                                unsedated individuals typically have BIS values >97.
                                With progressive drug-induced sedation, BIS™ numbers
                                decline, and BIS™ values should be interpreted with
                                this continuum in mind. A BIS value of 60 has a high
                                sensitivity for identifying drug-induced unconsciousness.
                                However, in some settings and with some combinations
                                of sedatives and analgesics, unconscious individuals may
                                have BIS values >60. BIS values &lt;30 signify increasing
                                amounts of EEG suppression. A BIS value of 0 represents
                                an isoelectric EEG signal.</p> 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                   <h4>Using BIS™ Monitoring During General Anesthesia (See Page 11)</h4>
                                <p> – Administration of general anesthesia involves using
                                anesthetic medications to induce and maintain
                                unconsciousness, and then reducing and/or
                                discontinuing the anesthetics to permit emergence and
                                return of consciousness. Anesthesia professionals should
                                appreciate that in the majority of clinical investigations
                                using BIS monitoring to help guide anesthetic agent
                                dosing, the primary anesthetics were adjusted to
                                maintain BIS values less than 60 during surgery.</p> 
                                 <p> – Consideration of BIS monitoring information may be
                                useful in various clinical situations that develop during
                                anesthesia care. Similarly, clinicians should also be
                                prepared to assess and respond to unexpected changes
                                in the BIS values. Ideally, BIS monitoring information
                                should be integrated with other available monitoring
                                information and patient assessment.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Special Issues Impacting BIS Monitoring (See Page 18)</h4>
                                <p> – It is important to understand that several clinical
                                situations can influence the accuracy of the BIS value
                                as an indicator of anesthetic hypnotic effect. Four key
                                areas include: the influence of muscle tone (EMG) from
                                the forehead muscles; electrical and mechanical artifacts
                                from medical devices; abnormal EEG states; and certain
                                anesthetic agents and adjuvants—which can all lead to
                                elevated BIS values. Serious clinical conditions—which
                                may require prompt response—have been associated
                                with the sudden appearance of low BIS™ values.</p>

                            <p> – A substantial number of randomized controlled trials
                                demonstrate the impact of BIS monitoring-guided
                                anesthesia care on patient outcomes. Compared with
                                standard clinical practice, adjusting primary anesthetic
                                dosing to maintain BIS values within a target range
                                (typically BIS values of 45 to 60 during maintenance)
                                has, with certain anesthetic agents, reduced anesthetic
                                dosing, emergence and recovery times. Use of BIS
                                monitoring to help guide anesthetic administration may
                                also be associated with the reduction of the incidence of
                                awareness with recall in adults during general anesthesia
                                and sedation.</p>

                                  <h4>BIS Monitoring and Reducing Awareness (See Page 25)</h4>
                            <p> – Unintended intraoperative awareness may occur in 0.1%
                            to 0.2% of adult patients undergoing general anesthesia.
                            Because of the potential for psychological injury,
                            numerous organizations are supporting efforts to reduce
                            the incidence of awareness. The effectiveness of BIS
                            monitoring has been demonstrated in two prospective
                            trials, and clinicians may wish to consider this evidence in
                            developing patient-specific strategies to avoid awareness.</p>

                                <h4>Important Information About Using BIS™ Monitoring</h4>
                                <p>BIS monitoring systems are intended for use by healthcare
                                personnel trained in their proper use. They are intended for
                                use on adult and pediatric patients to monitor the state of the
                                brain by data acquisition of EEG signals.</p>
                                <p><strong>BIS™ technology may be used as an aid in monitoring
                                the effects of certain anesthetic agents; its usage
                                with certain anesthetic agents may be associated
                                with a reduction in primary anesthetic use and a
                                reduction in emergence and recovery time. Use of BIS
                                monitoring to help guide anesthetic administration
                                may be associated with the reduction of the incidence
                                of awareness with recall in adults during general
                                anesthesia and sedation.</strong></p>
                                BIS monitoring is a complex technology intended for use as
                                an adjunct to clinical judgment and training. Clinical judgment
                                should always be used when interpreting BIS™ values in
                                conjunction with other available clinical signs. <strong>Reliance
                                on BIS values alone for intraoperative anesthetic
                                management is not recommended.</strong> As with any
                                monitored parameter, artifacts and poor signal quality may
                                lead to inappropriate BIS values. Potential artifacts may be
                                caused by poor skin contact (high impedance), muscle activity
                                or rigidity, head and body motion, sustained eye movements,
                                improper sensor placement and unusual or excessive electrical
                                interference. BIS values should also be interpreted cautiously
                                with certain anesthetic combinations, such as those relying
                                primarily on either ketamine or nitrous oxide/narcotics to
                                produce unconsciousness. Due to limited clinical experience
                                in the following applications, BIS values should be interpreted
                                cautiously in patients with known neurological disorders and
                                those taking other psychoactive medications.</div>

                            <p>The BIS Index is a processed EEG parameter with extensive validation and demonstrated clinical utility. It is derived utilizing a composite of measures from EEG signal processing techniques including bispectral analysis, power spectral analysis, and time domain analysis. These measures were combined via an algorithm to optimize the correlation between the EEG and the clinical effects of anesthesia, and quantified using the BIS Index range.</p>
							<p>In 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the BIS Index as an aid in monitoring the effects of certain anesthetic agents. In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration cleared an additional indication which states: "Use of BIS™ monitoring to help guide anesthetic administration may be associated with the reduction of the incidence of awareness with recall in adults during general anesthesia and sedation." The use of BIS monitoring to guide anesthetic administration and monitor patient status is a clinical decision. It is the responsibility of each clinician to make clinical practice decisions that are in the best interest of the patient.</p>
							<p>Today, the BIS Index remains the most validated form of consciousness or brain function monitoring used within the clinical context of anesthesia and sedation care. BIS Index values are the result of two particular innovations: bispectral analysis and the BIS™ algorithm.</p>
							<p>Bispectral analysis is a signal processing methodology that assesses relationships among signal components and captures synchronization within signals like the EEG. By quantifying the correlation between all the frequencies within the signal, bispectral analysis yields an additional EEG facet of brain activity. <sup>1</sup></p>
							<p>The BIS™ algorithm was developed to combine the EEG features (bispectral and others) that were highly correlated with sedation/hypnosis in the EEGs from more than 5,000 adult subjects. The four key EEG features that characterized the full spectrum of anesthetic-induced changes were the degree of high-frequency (14 to 30 Hz) activation, the amount of low-frequency synchronization, the presence of nearly suppressed periods within the EEG, and the presence of fully suppressed (i.e., isoelectric, “flatline”) periods within the EEG.<sup>2</sup> The algorithm enables the optimum combination of these EEG features to provide a reliable processed EEG parameter of anesthetic and sedative effect—the BIS™ Index (Figure 1)</p>

This chart reflects a general association between clinical state and BIS values. Ranges are based on results from a multicenter study of BIS values involving the administration of specific anesthetic agents. BIS values and ranges assume that the EEG is free of artifacts that can affect its performance. Titration of anesthetics to BIS value ranges should be dependent upon the individual goals established for each patient. These goals and associated BIS value ranges may vary over time and in the context of patient status and treatment plan.</figcaption>

                            <p>As BIS™ values decrease below 70, memory function is markedly impaired and the probability of explicit recall decreases dramatically. During sedation care, BIS values >70 may be observed during apparently adequate levels of sedation. At these levels, however, there may be a greater probability of consciousness and potential for recall. <sup>3</sup></p>
							<p>In volunteer studies, a threshold of BIS value &lt; 60 has a high sensitivity to reflect unconsciousness. As noted previously, the specificity of this threshold value may be quite dependent upon the anesthetic technique utilized—particularly with the combination of opioid analgesics. Although a continuum of responses may occur around a BIS value of 60, prospective clinical trials have demonstrated that maintaining BIS values in the range of 45 to 60 ensures adequate hypnotic effect during balanced general anesthesia while improving the recovery process. <sup>4</sup> Similarly, in two large prospective trials, maintaining BIS values less than 60 was the clinical strategy associated with  reducing the incidence of intraoperative awareness. <sup>5,6</sup></p>
							<p>BIS™ Index values lower than 40 signify a greater effect of the anesthetic on the EEG. At very low BIS values, the degree of EEG suppression is the primary determinant of the BIS value. <sup>7</sup> A BIS value of 0 occurs with detection of an isoelectric EEG signal.</p>
							<p>BIS value responses are similar when most, but not all, anesthetic agents are administered in increasing amounts. Specifically, BIS™ monitoring responses to typical hypnotic agents (midazolam, propofol, thiopental, isoflurane) were similar. <sup>8,9</sup> However, halothane has been found to have higher BIS values at an equipotent minimum alveolar concentration dose. <sup>10</sup> Further, BIS value responses to ketamine administration are atypical. <sup>11</sup></p>
							<p>In addition, BIS™ monitoring responses to administration of analgesic agents—including opioid analgesics and nitrous oxide—depend on the level of concomitant stimulation</p>
							<p>BIS™ Index values may reflect the reduced cerebral metabolic rate produced by most hypnotics. A significant correlation between BIS Index values and reduction in whole brain metabolic activity due to increasing anesthetic effect was measured using positron emission tomography (Figure 4). <sup>12</sup> However, factors other than drug administration that can influence brain metabolism (e.g., alterations in temperature or physiologic homeostasis) may also produce changes in the BIS Index.</p>

                            <p>Finally, it is important to note that the BIS value provides a measurement of brain status derived from the EEG, not the concentration of a particular drug. For example, BIS values decrease during natural sleep as well as during administration of an anesthetic agent. <sup>13</sup></p>

                            <p>BIS monitoring provides potentially useful information during each of three phases of a “typical” general anesthetic case:</p>
                            <ul class="list-arrow">
                                <li>Induction of anesthesia (and typically airway management)</li>

                                <li>Emergence from anesthesia</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>BIS™ systems display the BIS™ Index value as a single value,
                            calculated from data gathered over the last 15 to 30 seconds
                            of EEG recording and updated every second. Deriving the
                            BIS Index value from several seconds of EEG data effectively
                            “smooths” the data to prevent excessive fluctuations in BIS™
                            values. It also allows a value to be determined even if the EEG
                            signal is briefly interrupted. Most BIS systems allow the user
                            to change the smoothing rate to be appropriate to the clinical
                            environment.</p>
                            <p>A BIS value, while extremely responsive, is not instantaneously
                            altered by changes in clinical status. When abrupt changes
                            occur in hypnotic state—for example, during induction or
                            rapid emergence—the BIS value may lag behind the observed
                            clinical change by approximately 5 to 10 seconds.</p>
                            <p>Most BIS systems also display a graphical trend—the BIS™
                            trend (Table 1)—which represents the ongoing calculations
                            of the BIS Index during the case. Table 1 uses the BIS trend to
                            present the information available from BIS monitoring during
                            each of the three phases of a general anesthetic case.</p>

                                        <li>BIS responses are sensitive to various
adjuvants that influence intravenous induction
of anesthesia.15,16 </li>
                                        <li>During inhalation induction, BIS monitoring
reveals interpatient variability of onset time,
as well as the effect of other medications or
strategies.17-19</li>
                                        <li>BIS monitoring can facilitate different
strategies for intubation or placement of
airway devices (e.g., LMA).20</li>
                                        <li>BIS responses during intubation are also
important. History of and anticipated difficult
intubation are risk factors for intraoperative
awareness.21 Prolonged intubation attempts
may result in decreased hypnotic effect from
the induction agent without obvious somatic
movement.</li>
                                        <li>Because of these considerations, a good
strategy is to implement BIS monitoring along
with other standard patient monitors (ECG,
blood pressure, SpO2, capnography) prior to
induction in order to individualize patient care
during both induction and airway management.</li>

                                        <li>In response to noxious stimulation, BIS monitoring responses may be observed either parallel with or independent from hemodynamic responses.22,23,14</li>
                                        <li>Clinical trials demonstrate that adjustment
of anesthetic dosing to maintain BIS™ values
within a target range of 45 to 60 during
maintenance results in improved perioperative
recovery patterns as compared with standard
anesthesia care.4,25</li>
                                        <li>BIS responses to stimulation may be markedly
attenuated in a dose-dependent fashion
with opioid administration, e.g., fentanyl or
remifentanil.26</li>
                                        <li>BIS variability—the cyclic oscillation in BIS
values during surgery—may be useful to
observe. Both short-term BIS variability and
BIS-derived EMG activity have been useful
in assessing the adequacy of analgesia
in surgical patients. In volunteers, opioid
analgesia reduced BIS variability.27-30</li>

                                        <li>BIS monitoring permits reduction in anesthesia dosing in tandem with the decrease in surgical stimulation, promoting a rapid emergence that avoids premature recovery of consciousness as well as delayed emergence from anesthesia.</li>

                            <h5>Integrating BIS™ Monitoring Information During Anesthesia Care</h5>
                            <p>The integration of BIS monitoring with other traditional
                            monitoring has created new paradigms for intraoperative
                            patient assessment and management.<sup>31-33</sup> Table 2 outlines
                            conceptual management strategies based on integration
                            of clinical profile with BIS monitoring data for “balanced”
                            anesthesia techniques utilizing hypnotic and analgesic
                            components. Using the BIS™ value in combination with
                            hemodynamic data and patient assessment can facilitate the
                            rational selection of sedatives, analgesics and autonomic
                            blockers.</p>
                            <p>Although a BIS value of 40 to 60 is a typical target during
                            the maintenance phase, the BIS value target range needs to
                            be tailored to the anesthetic technique. For example, during
                            balanced anesthesia including opioid administration to
                            provide adequate analgesia, a target range of 45 to 60 may
                            be very appropriate. However, for anesthesia management
                            that utilizes little or no opioid or analgesic supplementation,
                            increased dosing of the hypnotic agent—typically, a volatile
                            anesthetic—to produce acceptable suppression of a noxious
                            stimulation response (e.g., movement) will result in lower BIS
                            values, commonly in the 25 to 35 range.</p>
                            <p>Since there is no single anesthetic technique that is appropriate
                            for every patient for every clinical situation, optimum use of
                            BIS monitoring to guide anesthesia care will depend upon
                            the clinical goals of the anesthesia professional. Based on
                            this consideration and agent-specific BIS value responses
                            (discussed in greater detail earlier), it is important to keep
                            in mind that there is no single BIS value or range that can be
                            recommended as appropriate for all patients, conditions and
                            anesthetic techniques.</p>
                            <p class="text-bold">It is important to emphasize that reliance on BIS™
                            monitoring alone for intraoperative anesthetic
                            management is not recommended. Clinical judgment is
                            crucial when interpreting BIS monitoring data. Patient
                            assessment should include evaluation and correlation of
                            BIS data with hemodynamic and other monitoring data
                            as well as observation of clinical signs. The BIS value is an
                            additional piece of information to be incorporated with
                            other information available for patient assessment.</p>

                            <p>Numerous prospective trials demonstrate that despite the
                            potential for artifact and other issues, reliable BIS values
                            can be obtained throughout many types of clinical cases.<sup>5,34</sup>
                            However, in certain circumstances, BIS™ values may not be
                            an accurate reflection of the hypnotic state. As noted, BIS
                            monitoring is an adjunct to clinical judgment, not a substitute
                            for it.</p>
                            <p>The clinician should be prepared to identify and respond
                            to situations where the underlying EEG signals—and
                            hence the BIS value—may not accurately reflect the clinical
                            endpoints of sedation and hypnosis. For example, BIS values
                            >60 may occur as the result of external artifacts, certain
                            pharmacologic agents, or other unrelated causes rather than
                            reflecting inadequate anesthetic effect and the potential for
                            intraoperative awareness. Similarly, BIS values &lt;40 may
                            develop as a consequence of serious clinical conditions, and
                            not merely from additional anesthetic effect. As mentioned,
                            alterations in physiologic status which reduce brain
                            metabolism may result in decreased BIS values.</p>
                            <p>A recent review paper provides a comprehensive discussion
                            of the spectrum of possible artifact and clinical conditions
                            which may impact the displayed BIS value.<sup>35</sup> It is important
                            for clinicians to consider these conditions when evaluating
                            unusual BIS values or trend responses. These conditions are

                            <p>When BIS™ monitoring is used during anesthesia care, fluctuations in BIS values will likely be noted. Such variability, like a single fluctuation in blood pressure, is not necessarily clinically significant. However, specific consideration should be given to sudden BIS value changes or situations where BIS values seem inappropriately high or low.</p>
                            <p>For example, changes in the hypnotic state due to changes in dose and/or patterns of agent delivery will produce changes in the BIS value. Normally, if the change in anesthetic dosing was incremental—e.g., slight adjustment in the vaporizer 
                            setting—subsequent changes in BIS values would be gradual. In contrast, a sudden dramatic change would be unexpected
                            and additional assessment would be appropriate.</p>
                            <p>Tables 4 and 5 present an assessment process for sudden increases or decreases in the BIS value.</p>

							<p>There is a large and growing body of scientific literature on BIS monitoring that can be reviewed by the practitioner to ascertain usage of BIS™ technology for a patient based on the type of anesthetic agent, dosage and individual patient parameters. </p>
							<p>To date, at least 25 prospective, randomized clinical investigations have measured the influence of BIS-guided anesthesia care compared with standard practice. In most of these studies, the primary anesthetic was adjusted to maintain BIS values in a "target zone," typically either 40 to 60 or 45 to 60.</p>
							<p>The range of benefits that have been observed in at least one clinical trial with certain anesthetic agents include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Reduction in primary anesthetic use<sup>4</sup></li> 
									<li>Reduction in emergence and recovery time<sup>4</sup></li>
									<li>Improved patient satisfaction <sup>36</sup></li>
									<li>Decreased incidence of intraoperative awareness and recall<sup>5,6</sup></li>
								</ul>	
							
							<p>The first two benefits above were shown in a study by Gan and co-workers that utilized propofol/alfentanil/nitrous oxide and found that 1) 13% to 23% less hypnotic drug was used; 2) 35% to 40% faster wake up was obtained; 3) 16% faster eligibility for PACU discharge was achieved; and 4) more patients were rated as “excellent-fully oriented” on admission to the PACU (43% vs 23%).<sup>4</sup></p>
							<p>As noted, BIS monitoring is also being recognized as an effective intervention to decrease the incidence of intraoperative awareness – an issue that has taken on new importance in the last several years. <sup>5,6</sup> Using BIS monitoring to reduce intraoperative awareness is discussed in detail in the following section.</p>

                            <p>Despite best intentions, a small percentage of patients undergoing general anesthesia regain consciousness unexpectedly and are able to form sufficient memory to recall portions of their intraoperative experience. This section discusses the role that BIS monitoring can play in decreasing the incidence of this adverse event.</p>

                            <p>In several large-scale prospective investigations, the incidence
                            of intraoperative awareness has been measured to occur during general anesthesia in 0.1% to 0.2% of patients.<sup>37-39</sup> In 2004, the Joint Commission’s Sentinel Event Alert #32 noted that each year, 20,000 to 40,000 patients may become cognizant and have recall of events during surgery.<sup>40</sup></p>
                            <p>An overview of various perioperative factors that put patients at increased risk for awareness is presented in Table 6. Presence of some of these risk factors has been reported to increase the relative risk for awareness to nearly 1% of patients.</p>

                            <p>The presumed cause of intraoperative awareness is a period of inadequate anesthetic effect resulting from an insufficient anesthetic dose, disruption of anesthetic delivery, or potentially inherent anesthetic resistance.<sup>41</sup> For example, in some clinical situations, administration of very low anesthetic doses may be appropriate in light of hemodynamic compromise or other clinical goals. These doses, however, are associated with a higher frequency of intraoperative awareness.</p>
                            <p>Patient reports include frightening descriptions of intraoperative awareness, highlighting the potentially horrendous sensations and emotions that may occur if anesthetic effect is inadequate.<sup>42</sup> Patients who experience intraoperative awareness may develop a spectrum of psychological injury ranging from mild, transient symptoms to severe, disabling symptoms consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder.<sup>43</sup></p>
                            <h4>ASA Practice Advisory</h4>
                            <p>The Practice Advisory for Intraoperative Awareness and
                            Brain Function Monitoring published in 2006 describes using multiple monitoring modalities—clinical techniques,
                            conventional monitoring and brain function monitoring 
                            —to assess anesthetic depth and reduce the likelihood of
                            intraoperative awareness.<sup>21</sup> The Practice Advisory consensus
                            opinion was that “the decision to use a brain function monitor
                            should be made on a case-by-case basis by the individual
                            practitioner for selected patients.” It should be noted that
                            the Practice Advisory also stated that brain monitoring is
                            not routinely indicated for all patients undergoing general
                            anesthesia, and that brain function monitoring currently has
                            the same status as the many other monitoring modalities used
                            in selected situations determined by individual clinicians.</p>
                            <p>The ASA Practice Advisory aims to help the anesthesia
                            professional develop a clinical strategy to minimize the
                            occurrence of awareness. Such a strategy involves elements
                            of care occurring throughout the perioperative period—
                            preoperative assessment and preparation, intraoperative
                            monitoring and intervention, and postoperative follow-up
                            activities. An overview of the resulting clinical strategy is
                            presented in Table 7. Alternatively, clinicians may wish to
                            implement the algorithm approach presented in Figure 5 to
                            minimize the risk for awareness.</p>
                            <p>The Practice Advisory also alerted anesthesia clinicians to
                            recognize that dosing anesthetic agents to achieve certain
                            brain function values in an attempt to prevent intraoperative
                            awareness may conflict with other medical concerns including
                            vital organ function and existing co-morbidity.21 Similarly,
                            the Joint Commission’s Sentinel Event Alert #32 noted that
                            anesthesia professionals must weigh the psychological risks
                            of anesthesia awareness against the physiological risks of
                            excessive anesthesia. <sup>40</sup></p>

                                as several case reports. <sup>45-48</sup></p>
                                <p>The two large prospective trials provide a clinical management
                                framework for effectively using BIS monitoring. In one
                                investigation, the anesthesia staff was instructed to maintain
                                BIS™ values within a range of 40 to 60, and to avoid values
                                greater than 60 during induction and maintenance.<sup>5</sup> This
                                management resulted in significant benefit: only two patients
                                in the 4,945 treated patients reported awareness, representing
                                a 77% reduction compared to the investigators’ prior study
                                (Figure 6).</p>

                                <p>In the other randomized trial involving patients at increased
                                risk for awareness, BIS™ monitoring was initiated prior to
                                induction, and the delivery of anesthetics was titrated to
                                maintain BIS™ values between 40 to 60 from laryngoscopy
                                until wound closure.<sup>6</sup> This care resulted in an 82% reduction
                                in the incidence of awareness (Figure 7).</p>

                                <p>In each study, two episodes of awareness were reported in
                                patients despite the use of BIS monitoring. All four cases of
                                awareness occurred during periods of significant noxious
                                stimulation (e.g., intubation, median sternotomy) and were
                                associated with BIS values near or greater than 60. These
                                cases highlight the need for the anesthesia professional to
                                be particularly vigilant to BIS value responses to noxious
                                stimulation and to be prepared to intervene promptly when
                                BIS values exceed 60 for some time.</p>
                                <h4>Intraoperative Awareness and Anesthesia Practice</h4>
                                <p>In addition to the ASA, professional societies from around the
                                world have addressed the specific topic of brain monitoring
                                to prevent awareness. The American Association of Nurse
                                Anesthetists,<sup>49</sup> the Royal College of Anaesthetists and the
                                Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland<sup>50</sup>
                                and the Australian and New Zealand College of Anesthetists<sup>51</sup>
                                emphasize that brain function monitors be considered for use
                                and/or available in clinical situations that place a patient at
                                increased risk for awareness. For example, the AANA’s 2006
                                Position Statement advised that “brain function monitoring,
                                if available, should be considered particularly in situations
                                where the risk of intraoperative awareness is increased.”<sup>49</sup>
                                These statements augment the opinions of ASA members:
                                69% of ASA members surveyed in the Practice Advisory
                                agreed or strongly agreed with the statement: “Brain function
                                monitors are valuable and should be used to reduce the risk of
                                intraoperative awareness for patients with conditions that may
                                place them at risk for intraoperative awareness.”</p>
                                <p>It should be appreciated that other patients, without
                                recognized risk factors, will experience awareness due to
                                unanticipated or unrecognized intraoperative events. It is
                                important to remember the clinical evidence demonstrating
                                the efficacy of BIS™ monitoring in this situation as well.<sup>5</sup></p>

                            <p>Despite remarkable improvements in the assessment of the
                            cardiovascular and respiratory systems during anesthesia,
                            determination of the effect of anesthetic agents on the central
                            nervous system had remained a challenge. Now, technologies
                            that permit routine neurophysiologic monitoring of the
                            central nervous system provide a direct measure of anesthetic
                            effect during anesthesia.<sup>52</sup> Combining brain function
                            monitoring with traditional monitoring and assessment of
                            clinical signs, can provide the anesthesia professional a more
                            complete approach to optimizing the selection and/or dosing
                            of anesthetic and adjuvant agents for each patient.</p>
                                                        <p>Concerns regarding the consequences of both inadequate and
                            excessive anesthetic effect have increased in the last few years.
                            As noted previously, inadequate anesthetic effect is the primary
                            etiology of unintentional intraoperative awareness.<sup>41</sup> This
                            adverse event was discussed in detail in the previous section.</p>
                                                        <p>Excessive anesthetic effect also has consequences. In
                            some situations, excessive anesthetic effect may result in
                            cardiovascular depression, and very rarely, cardiac arrest.<sup>53</sup>
                            More recently, new concerns about other consequences
                            of excessive anesthetic effect have appeared. Exposure to
                            high doses of volatile anesthetic is a risk for acute transient
                            epileptiform changes in the EEG.<sup>54</sup> In addition, excessive
                            anesthetic effect has been associated with adverse long-term
                            outcome.<sup>55,56</sup></p>
                                                        <p>The ability of brain function monitoring to allow the anesthesia
                            professional to monitor patient-specific anesthetic effect is
                            important. Avoidance of excessive anesthetic effect reduces the
                            occurrence of prolonged recovery and delayed orientation.<sup>4,36,57</sup></p>
                                                        <p>As future investigations and clinical experience establish
                            the potential short-term and long-term risks of excessive
                            anesthetic effect, it may become important for anesthesia
                            professionals to better modulate patient exposure to
                            anesthesia. Given the increasing recognition of consequences
                            of excessive—as well as inadequate—anesthetic effect, it is
                            likely that more anesthesia clinicians will integrate brain
                            function monitoring into overall anesthesia management.</p>

                            <p>This pocket guide discussed how BIS™ brain function monitoring can be used most effectively during the different phases of anesthesia care. It is important for anesthesia professionals to fully appreciate the applications, limitations and special considerations for use of BIS™ monitoring.</p>
                            <p>During the past decade, BIS monitoring has been utilized in the care of more than 18 million patients with a well documented safety and efficacy record. As a result, BIS monitoring is well established as a useful device within the anesthesia professional's realm.</p>
                            <p>Evidence in the literature documents patient benefits in the area of safety and in the quality of anesthesia care resulting from the use of BIS monitoring. These clinical investigations provide an evidence-based rationale for incorporation of BIS monitoring as a tool to facilitate intraoperative management with certain anesthetic agents.</p>
                            <p>Depending upon the specific patient characteristics, surgical procedure and planned anesthetic technique, utilization of BIS monitoring may be a very appropriate decision. However, the decision to use BIS monitoring should be made on a case-by- case basis by the individual practitioner.</p>
                            <p>As clinical experience and investigation continue, anesthesia clinicians are encouraged to stay current with available literature regarding the use, benefits and limitations of BIS monitoring to guide patient care.
